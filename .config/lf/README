# lf config

A lot of the config is borrowed/copied from [LukeSmithxyz](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/blob/master/.config/lf/lfrc)

### Setting up image previews

I use two different previewers based on whether user wants to preview images on it. For the image preview:
 1. ueberzug must be installed.
 2. The img_pv file (~/.config/lf/img_pv.sh for me), must have a command similar to mine to generate ueberzug images.
 3. A `set cleaner` line as below is a cleaner script.
 4. lf should be started through a wrapper script (~/.local/bin/lfub for me) that creates the environment for ueberzug. This command can be be aliased in your shellrc (`alias lf="lfub") or if set to a binding, should be called directly instead of normal lf.
